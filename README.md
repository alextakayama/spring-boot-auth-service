# 🔐 Spring Boot Auth Service

It is intended for educational purposes and as a foundation for further development. Use with caution and implement necessary security measures before deploying in a real environment.*

## 🚀 Why I Built This
Not long ago, in the early days of the internet, building your own Identity and Access Management (IAM) system was standard practice for developers. Today, with convenient services like Auth0 and Cognito, this fundamental knowledge isn't as widespread among developers who have grown accustomed to these abstractions. I built this project to explore and share these critical security and architectural concepts that shaped the web.
